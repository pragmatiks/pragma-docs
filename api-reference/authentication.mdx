All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. This guide explains how to obtain and use tokens.

## Getting a Token

You can get an authentication token using the CLI:

```bash
pragma auth login
```

This opens your browser for authentication. After successful login, your token is stored locally.

To view your current token for API calls:

```bash
pragma auth token
```

## Using Tokens

Include your token in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  https://api.pragmatiks.io/resources/
```

## Token Lifecycle

Tokens are JWTs issued by Clerk and have a limited lifetime. The CLI automatically refreshes tokens when needed. If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response, re-authenticate:

```bash
pragma auth login
```

## Request Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes | Bearer token for authentication |
| `Content-Type` | For POST/PUT | `application/json` for JSON bodies, `multipart/form-data` for file uploads |

## Example: Authenticated Request

```bash
# Set your token
TOKEN=$(pragma auth token)

# List resources
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://api.pragmatiks.io/resources/
```

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

Your token identifies your organization. All API requests are automatically scoped to your organization's namespace. You cannot access resources belonging to other organizations.

## Error Responses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid token |
| `403 Forbidden` | Token valid but lacks permission for the requested operation |

```json
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```
