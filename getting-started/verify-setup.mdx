After completing the [quickstart](/quickstart), verify that your resources are installed and functioning as expected. This guide shows you how to check resource status, understand lifecycle states, and troubleshoot common verification failures.

## Check Resource Status

List all your installed resources:

```bash
pragma resources list
```

After completing the quickstart, you should see output like:

```
gcp/storage/my-first-bucket [READY]
```

The `[READY]` status indicates your bucket was provisioned successfully.

## Understanding Lifecycle States

Resources move through several states during provisioning:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **PENDING** | Queued and waiting - either for dependencies to be ready or for processing to begin |
| **PROVISIONING** | Currently being created by the provider |
| **READY** | Successfully provisioned and operational |
| **FAILED** | Something went wrong during provisioning |

<Tip>
A resource in PENDING state is normal immediately after applying. It should transition to PROVISIONING within a few seconds, then to READY once complete.
</Tip>

## Get Resource Details

View detailed information about a specific resource:

```bash
pragma resources get gcp/storage my-first-bucket
```

This shows:

- Current lifecycle state
- Configuration values
- Output values (like the bucket URL)
- Any error messages if the resource failed

For a successful bucket, you'll see outputs like:

```yaml
outputs:
  bucket_url: "gs://my-first-bucket-abc123"
  self_link: "https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/my-first-bucket-abc123"
```

## Verify in GCP Console

You can also confirm the resource exists in your GCP project:

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to **Cloud Storage > Buckets**
3. Find your bucket by name (it will have a unique suffix like `my-first-bucket-abc123`)

The bucket should be visible with the location you specified (`EU` in the quickstart example).

## Troubleshooting Verification Failures

### Resource Stuck in PENDING

If a resource stays in PENDING state for more than a few minutes:

- **Check dependencies** - Resources wait for their dependencies to reach READY first
- **Verify credentials** - Your GCP credentials may have expired

```bash
# Refresh credentials if needed
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### Resource Shows FAILED

A failed resource means something went wrong during provisioning. Check the error details:

```bash
pragma resources get gcp/storage my-first-bucket
```

Common failure causes:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Permission denied | Ensure your GCP account has Storage Admin role |
| Quota exceeded | Check your project quotas in GCP Console |
| Invalid configuration | Review your YAML for typos or invalid values |

### Resource Not Appearing in List

If `pragma resources list` shows nothing:

- Verify you applied the resource with `pragma resources apply bucket.yaml`
- Check you're authenticated: `pragma auth whoami`
- Ensure the YAML file has valid syntax

## Recovering from Failures

If your resource is in FAILED state:

1. Check the error message with `pragma resources get`
2. Fix the underlying issue (permissions, configuration, etc.)
3. Re-apply the resource:

```bash
pragma resources apply --pending bucket.yaml
```

For more complex recovery scenarios, see the [Error Recovery guide](/guides/error-recovery).
