## Login

```bash
pragma auth login
```

Opens your browser for authentication.

## Check Status

```bash
pragma auth whoami
```

## Logout

```bash
pragma auth logout
```

## Contexts

Contexts allow you to switch between different Pragmatiks environments—for example, development and production—each with its own API endpoint and credentials.

Each context stores:
- **API URL** - The endpoint for that environment
- **Authentication token** - Your credentials for that environment

This is useful when you need to work with multiple deployments or test against a local development server.

<Note>
You can override the current context for a single command using the `--context` / `-c` flag, or set the `PRAGMA_CONTEXT` environment variable.
</Note>

### List Contexts

```bash
pragma config get-contexts
```

### Switch Context

```bash
pragma config use-context production
```

### Create Context

```bash
pragma config set-context staging --api-url <url>
```

### Delete Context

```bash
pragma config delete-context staging
```
