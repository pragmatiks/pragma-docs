description: "The operating system for AI infrastructure - install pre-built resources in minutes, not weeks"
---

Think of pragma-os like iOS for your data infrastructure. Instead of manually wiring together storage, compute, and AI services, you browse a marketplace of pre-built resources and install what you need. Dependencies resolve automatically. When upstream data changes, downstream resources update themselves.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse">
    Explore the marketplace for the resources you need - storage buckets, datasets, vector databases, RAG pipelines, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Set your parameters: project, region, naming. Each resource knows what it needs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-sync">
    pragma-os provisions everything and keeps it in sync. When sources change, dependent resources automatically update.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why pragma-os

## Example: RAG Pipeline

Building a RAG pipeline traditionally means weeks of work - setting up storage, configuring vector databases, wiring embedding services, managing sync jobs. With pragma-os, you describe what you want:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: storage
name: documents
config:
  location: EU
  lifecycle:
    delete_after_days: 365
```

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: embeddings
config:
  location: EU
depends_on:
  - documents
```

```bash
pragma resources apply .
```

pragma-os provisions both resources and establishes the dependency. When new documents land in storage, the embeddings dataset knows about it. The full RAG pipeline example with vector search is coming soon.
