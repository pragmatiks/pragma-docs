title: "How pragma-os Compares"
description: "Understand where pragma-os fits in the data infrastructure landscape"
---

pragma-os isn't trying to replace everything. Different tools solve different problems. Here's where we fit.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="vs Terraform">
    ## vs Infrastructure as Code

    Infrastructure as Code tools excel at **provisioning**. You declare what you want, they create it. But what happens after?

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Terraform / Pulumi" icon="hashtag">
        - Provisions infrastructure
        - Changes require manual cascade
        - Dependencies resolved at build-time
        - Best for static infrastructure
      </Card>
      <Card title="pragma-os" icon="p">
        - Provisions **and maintains**
        - Changes propagate automatically
        - Dependencies are runtime reactive
        - Best for dynamic data infrastructure
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Info>
    **The key difference**: IaC provisions once. When your warehouse changes, you manually update dependent projects and run `terraform apply` again. pragma-os maintains continuously—changes propagate automatically through your dependency graph.
    </Info>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="vs Airflow">
    ## vs Orchestration

    Orchestrators are fantastic at **scheduling and running tasks**. They're the backbone of data pipelines everywhere.

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Airflow / Prefect / Dagster" icon="clock">
        - Schedules and runs tasks
        - Manages task-level dependencies
        - Runs workflows on infrastructure
        - Best for data pipelines
      </Card>
      <Card title="pragma-os" icon="p">
        - Provisions and maintains infrastructure
        - Manages infrastructure-level dependencies
        - Provides the platform layer
        - Best for platform infrastructure
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Info>
    **The key difference**: Orchestrators schedule tasks that run *on* infrastructure. pragma-os manages *that infrastructure*. Your Airflow DAG transforms data in BigQuery—pragma-os ensures BigQuery exists, is configured correctly, and stays in sync.
    </Info>

    <Tip>
    These tools **complement each other**. pragma-os handles the platform layer so your orchestrator can focus on running pipelines.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="vs Databricks">
    ## vs Platform-as-a-Service

    Managed platforms are powerful. They handle operations so you can focus on workloads.

    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Databricks / Snowflake" icon="database">
        - Vertical integration
        - Opinionated stack
        - Vendor-specific ecosystem
        - Best for specific workloads
      </Card>
      <Card title="pragma-os" icon="p">
        - Horizontal platform
        - Any tool combination
        - Open ecosystem
        - Best for custom platforms
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Info>
    **The key difference**: PaaS platforms optimize for specific workloads within their ecosystem. pragma-os lets you build custom platforms from any combination of tools.
    </Info>

    This isn't about replacing these platforms—it's about orchestrating them as part of a larger, cohesive system.

## When to Use pragma-os

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multiple Tools" icon="layer-group">
    Your stack includes BigQuery, dbt, vector databases, and more. You need them to work together.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Dependencies" icon="arrows-rotate">
    When your warehouse changes, your transformations should adapt. When your source evolves, your pipelines should respond.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product Focus" icon="bullseye">
    You'd rather ship features than chase cascading configuration changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Platform Team" icon="users">
    You need platform-team capabilities without hiring a platform team.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When pragma-os Might Not Be Right

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="You only need one tool">
    If you're just using BigQuery, use BigQuery directly. pragma-os adds value when you're coordinating multiple systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Your infrastructure is completely static">
    If nothing changes after initial setup, Terraform works fine. pragma-os shines when infrastructure is dynamic.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="You have a mature platform team">
    If you've built internal tooling that handles dependency propagation, you might not need to adopt something new.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

<Card title="pragma-os solves maintenance" icon="wrench">
  It's not a replacement for Terraform, Airflow, or Snowflake—it's what **ties them together** and keeps them in sync as your infrastructure evolves.
