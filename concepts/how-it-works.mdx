Think of pragma-os like the operating system on your phone. You don't build apps from scratch—you install them from a marketplace, configure them to your needs, and they just work. When one app updates, others that depend on it adapt automatically.

pragma-os brings this same experience to infrastructure.

## The OS Metaphor

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Resources" icon="cube">
    **Like apps you install**

    Infrastructure components—storage buckets, datasets, APIs—that you declare and pragma-os provisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Providers" icon="plug">
    **Like app developers**

    Teams that build and maintain resources. They handle complexity so you don't have to.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reactive Dependencies" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **Like auto-updates**

    When one resource changes, dependent resources automatically adapt.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Instead of writing Terraform modules, managing state files, and debugging deployment scripts, you declare what you need and pragma-os handles the rest.

## Resources

A resource is an infrastructure component you want to use—a storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, a service account. You "install" resources by declaring them:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
config:
  location: EU
```

That's it. No provider blocks, no state management, no `terraform apply`. pragma-os creates the dataset, tracks its state, and manages its entire lifecycle.

<Tip>
Resources come pre-built and tested. You configure them for your needs, just like adjusting app settings.
</Tip>

---

## Providers

Providers know how to manage specific resource types. Think of them as app developers who handle all the complexity so you don't have to.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GCP Provider">
    Manages Google Cloud Platform resources:
    - Storage buckets with proper IAM
    - BigQuery datasets and tables
    - Service accounts and permissions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pragma Provider">
    Manages platform-level resources:
    - Secrets and credentials
    - Configuration values
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You never interact with providers directly. You declare resources, and pragma-os routes them to the right provider automatically.

---

## Reactive Dependencies

Here's where pragma-os really shines. Infrastructure components depend on each other—a data pipeline needs a storage bucket, which needs a service account. Managing these dependencies manually is error-prone.

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
depends_on:
  - gcp/storage/data-lake
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="You update a resource">
    The `data-lake` bucket configuration changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="pragma-os detects the change">
    The dependency graph identifies affected resources.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dependents automatically update">
    The `analytics` dataset re-evaluates and adapts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This isn't just about creation order. It's a reactive system—changes propagate through your infrastructure graph automatically.

## Why This Matters

  <Card title="Faster Setup" icon="rocket">
    Install resources, don't build them. Minutes instead of weeks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fewer Errors" icon="shield-check">
    Dependencies are tracked automatically, not manually managed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Less Maintenance" icon="wrench">
    Changes propagate automatically. No more chasing cascading updates.
