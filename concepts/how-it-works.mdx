Think of pragma-os like the operating system on your phone. You don't build apps from scratch—you install them from a marketplace, configure them to your needs, and they just work. When one app updates, others that depend on it adapt automatically.

pragma-os brings this same experience to infrastructure.

## The OS Metaphor

| Your Phone | pragma-os |
|------------|-----------|
| Apps you install | **Resources** - infrastructure components |
| App developers | **Providers** - teams that build and maintain resources |
| Auto-updates | **Reactive dependencies** - changes propagate automatically |

Instead of writing Terraform modules, managing state files, and debugging deployment scripts, you declare what you need and pragma-os handles the rest.

## Resources: Infrastructure as Apps

A resource is an infrastructure component you want to use—a storage bucket, a BigQuery dataset, a service account. You "install" resources by declaring them:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
config:
  location: EU
```

That's it. No provider blocks, no state management, no `terraform apply`. pragma-os creates the dataset, tracks its state, and manages its entire lifecycle.

Resources come pre-built and tested. You configure them for your needs, just like adjusting app settings.

## Providers: The Experts Behind the Scenes

Providers are the teams (or tools) that know how to manage specific resource types. Think of them as app developers who handle all the complexity so you don't have to.

The **GCP provider** knows how to create and manage:
- Storage buckets with proper IAM
- BigQuery datasets and tables
- Service accounts and permissions

The **Pragma provider** manages platform-level resources like secrets and configurations.

You never interact with providers directly. You declare resources, and pragma-os routes them to the right provider automatically.

## Reactive Dependencies: Everything Stays in Sync

Here's where pragma-os really shines. Infrastructure components depend on each other—a data pipeline needs a storage bucket, which needs a service account. Managing these dependencies manually is error-prone and tedious.

pragma-os tracks dependencies automatically:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: bigquery-dataset
name: analytics
depends_on:
  - gcp/storage/data-lake
```

When the `data-lake` bucket changes, pragma-os knows to re-evaluate the `analytics` dataset. When a service account's permissions update, everything that depends on it responds accordingly.

This isn't just about creation order. It's a reactive system—changes propagate through your infrastructure graph automatically, keeping everything consistent.

```

You work at the top—declaring resources and their relationships. pragma-os manages the middle—tracking dependencies and orchestrating changes. Providers do the heavy lifting at the bottom—actually creating and modifying infrastructure.

## Why This Matters

Traditional infrastructure-as-code tools make you think like a computer: define every resource, manage state, handle ordering, debug conflicts. pragma-os inverts this. You describe what you want, and the system figures out how to make it happen.

This means:
- **Faster setup**: Install resources, don't build them
- **Fewer errors**: Dependencies are tracked, not manually managed
- **Less maintenance**: Changes propagate automatically
- **Better visibility**: See your entire infrastructure as a connected graph
