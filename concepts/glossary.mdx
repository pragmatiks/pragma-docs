## Resource

The fundamental unit in pragma-os. A resource represents a single infrastructure component that can be provisioned, configured, and managed. Each resource has a unique identifier composed of `provider/resource/name` (e.g., `gcp/storage/data-lake`).

Resources are declarative: you specify the desired state, and pragma-os ensures the actual state matches.

## Provider

A provider manages one or more resource types. Providers handle the lifecycle operations for their resources: creation, updates, and deletion. Each provider knows how to translate resource configurations into actual infrastructure.

Examples: `gcp` provider manages GCP resources, `pragma` provider manages platform-internal resources.

## Config

The configuration block of a resource. Config contains the settings that define how a resource should be provisioned. These are provider-specific—each resource type accepts different configuration options.

```yaml
config:
  location: EU
  storage_class: STANDARD
```

## Outputs

Values that a resource exposes after provisioning. Outputs allow other resources to reference dynamically-generated values like IDs, URLs, or connection strings. Outputs are only available when a resource reaches READY state.

```yaml
# Available after provisioning:
outputs:
  bucket_url: "gs://pragma-data-lake-abc123"
  self_link: "https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/pragma-data-lake-abc123"
```

## depends_on

Declares explicit dependencies between resources. When resource A depends on resource B, pragma-os ensures B reaches READY state before processing A. Dependencies also trigger automatic updates: when B changes, A is notified.

```yaml
depends_on:
  - gcp/storage/data-lake
  - gcp/bigquery-dataset/source
```

## FieldReference

A dynamic value reference using the syntax `${provider/resource/name.outputs.field}`. Field references resolve at runtime to the actual output values from dependency resources.

```yaml
config:
  source_bucket: "${gcp/storage/data-lake.outputs.bucket_url}"
```

When the referenced resource updates, the field reference automatically resolves to the new value.

## Lifecycle States

Resources move through these states as pragma-os manages them:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **DRAFT** | Resource defined but not queued for provisioning |
| **PENDING** | Queued and waiting for dependencies to be ready |
| **PROVISIONING** | Currently being created by the provider |
| **READY** | Successfully provisioned and operational |
| **UPDATING** | Configuration change in progress |
| **DELETING** | Being removed |
| **FAILED** | Provisioning or update failed |

State transitions are managed by pragma-os based on provider responses and dependency status.
