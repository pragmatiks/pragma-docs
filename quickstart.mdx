description: "Install your first cloud resource with pragma-os"
---

Welcome to pragma-os, the operating system for AI infrastructure. In this guide, you'll install your first cloud resource - a GCP storage bucket.

<Tip>
New to pragma-os? See [How It Works](/concepts/how-it-works) to understand the model before diving in.
</Tip>

<Note>
The web marketplace is coming soon. For now, you define resources in YAML and install them via the CLI.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- A [Pragmatiks account](https://pragmatiks.io)

## Install the CLI

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="uvx">
    ```bash
    uvx pragmatiks-cli
    ```

    Or install globally:

    ```bash
    uv tool install pragmatiks-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pipx">
    ```bash
    pipx install pragmatiks-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="pip">
    ```bash
    pip install pragmatiks-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authenticate

```bash
pragma auth login
```

This opens your browser. Sign in, and you're connected.

## Install your first resource

Create a resource definition called `bucket.yaml`:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: storage
name: my-first-bucket
config:
  location: EU
```

Now install it:

```bash
pragma resources apply bucket.yaml
```

That's it - your infrastructure is ready.

## See it in action

Check the status of your installed resources:

```bash
pragma resources list
```

You just installed your first resource.
