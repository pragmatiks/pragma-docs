Welcome to pragma-os, the operating system for AI infrastructure. In this guide, you'll install your first cloud resource - a GCP storage bucket - and see how easy infrastructure management can be.

<Note>
The web marketplace is coming soon. For now, you define resources in YAML and install them via the CLI.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- A [Pragmatiks account](https://pragmatiks.io)

## Install the CLI

```bash
pip install pragma-cli
```

## Authenticate

```bash
pragma auth login
```

This opens your browser. Sign in, and you're connected.

## Install your first resource

Create a resource definition called `bucket.yaml`:

```yaml
provider: gcp
resource: storage
name: my-first-bucket
config:
  location: EU
```

Now install it:

```bash
pragma resources apply bucket.yaml
```

That's it - your infrastructure is ready.

## See it in action

Check the status of your installed resources:

```bash
pragma resources list
```

You just installed your first resource. From a simple definition to running infrastructure in seconds.
