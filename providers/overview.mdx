The marketplace is where you find resources to install. Browse available resources like an app store, then install what you need with a single command.

## Provider Tiers

Resources are built and maintained by providers. We categorize them into three tiers:

|------|-------------|--------|
| **First-party** | Built and maintained by Pragmatiks. Guaranteed to work and fully supported. | Available |
| **Verified Partners** | Certified by Pragmatiks, maintained by partners. | Coming soon |
| **Community** | Shared by the community. | Coming soon |
